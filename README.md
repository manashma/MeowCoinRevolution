## **1. Understanding Blockchain and BEP20**

### **1.1 What is Blockchain?**
Blockchain is a **decentralized** digital ledger where every transaction is validated and recorded across a network of computers. This technology ensures **immutability, transparency**, and **security**, making it ideal for financial transactions and record-keeping.

<span style="color: #FF9800;">Key features of Blockchain:</span>
- **Decentralized**: No central authority controls the network.
- **Transparent**: All transactions are visible and traceable.
- **Secure**: Transactions are cryptographically verified.

### **1.2 Why BEP20?**
The **BEP20** standard on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) was chosen for MeowCoinRevolution for its **speed, low transaction costs**, and **scalability**. BSC provides an efficient environment for launching decentralized applications (dApps) and digital tokens like MeowCoin.

### **1.3 Advantages of Blockchain Technology**
- **Security**: Blockchain’s immutable nature ensures data cannot be tampered with.
- **Transparency**: Everyone can see transaction history without compromising privacy.
- **Efficiency**: Blockchain eliminates intermediaries, reducing fees and speeding up transactions.
